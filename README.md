# Smart Running Route Planner

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The Smart Running Route Planner is an AI-driven application that suggests optimal running routes based on user preferences, real-time data, and safety considerations. It aims to enhance the running experience by providing personalized and safe route options.

## Background

The Smart Running Route Planner addresses several common problems faced by runners:
* Difficulty in finding safe and enjoyable running routes.
* Lack of personalized route suggestions based on individual preferences (e.g., distance, terrain).
* Inability to account for real-time factors such as weather, traffic, and air quality.

As an avid runner, I understand the importance of having safe and enjoyable routes. This interesting topic combines technology with fitness, promoting healthier lifestyles while ensuring user safety.

## How is it used?

Users can access the Smart Running Route Planner through a mobile app or web interface. The process involves:
1. Inputting personal preferences (e.g., desired distance, terrain type, and safety concerns).
2. The app analyzes real-time data (e.g., weather conditions, traffic, and air quality) to generate route suggestions.
3. Users can view the suggested routes on a map, complete with distance and estimated time.

This solution is particularly useful in urban environments where safety and air quality can vary significantly. The primary users are recreational runners, fitness enthusiasts, and those training for events who seek safe and enjoyable running experiences.

## Data sources and AI methods

The Smart Running Route Planner utilizes various data sources:
* OpenStreetMap for mapping and route data.
* Weather APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) for real-time weather conditions.
* Traffic data from local traffic management systems or APIs.

AI methods include:
* Machine learning algorithms to analyze user preferences and suggest optimal routes.
* Natural language processing to interpret user input and preferences.

| Data Source      | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| OpenStreetMap    | Provides mapping and route data for runners. |
| OpenWeatherMap   | Supplies real-time weather information. |
| Traffic APIs     | Offers data on current traffic conditions. |

## Challenges

The Smart Running Route Planner does not solve all issues related to running safety and enjoyment. Limitations include:
* Inability to account for all personal safety concerns (e.g., crime rates in certain areas).
* Dependence on the accuracy of real-time data, which may not always be reliable.
* Ethical considerations regarding user privacy and data security.

## What next?

The project could grow by incorporating additional features such as:
* Community-driven route reviews and ratings.
* Integration with wearable devices for real-time performance tracking.
* Enhanced AI capabilities for more personalized suggestions.

To move forward, I need skills in mobile app development, data visualization, and further expertise in machine learning. Assistance from developers and data scientists would also be beneficial.
